Final SQL Project Description:
In the final project of the SQL course, a relational database is designed and built from scratch. The project includes creating tables, defining relationships, and populating the database with sample data. Once the database is set up, various SQL queries are developed to retrieve meaningful insights, perform data analysis, and demonstrate a solid understanding of database management and query writing.
